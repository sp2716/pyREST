Making a RESTful web service using Python Flask Package
    This Repo is to test and develop a web service capable of filling out a form and creating a JSON configuration.
    This configuration resides on the same docker container as a Modbus/TCP Server - such that the configuration
    of the server can be updated live while a socket connection is maintained to a Modbus/TCP Client
